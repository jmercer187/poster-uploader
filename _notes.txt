gather api reference: 
https://www.notion.so/EXTERNAL-Gather-http-API-3bbf6c59325f40aca7ef5ce14c677444

### POST https://gather.town/api/setMap
For setting the contents of a map
**Takes**       JSON encoded, in body:

- apiKey: Your api key
- spaceId: Id of the space for the map you want to get the contents of
- mapId: Id of the map within the space
- mapContent: the new map content, in the same format as what is returned from getMap

**Returns**     nothing

neurIPS thing that does this
https://github.com/Mini-Conf/Mini-Conf/tree/master/gather

we create a map (room) for the space identified by user
user can create multiple rooms and specify w/ images go to which room
we need to find a way to separate preview images from poster images
    -> separate uplaods?
    -> have internal function that creates a preview for them?
        ** this is probably easiest for user .. and also us too probably

step 1
    -> validate submission
        - image type, file size, file count (50 max)
            ** note accept PDFs, JPEGs, TIFs, and PNGs and then transform everything into PNGs
            ** if I were smart I'd put the file type validation in the back end
    -> validate spaceId (char min? anything else?)

step 2
    -> build out (async if we're letting them submit more than one) setRoom submission object
    -> do some math to determine poster spacing and location
    -> add in private space tiles (base this partly on user submission)

step 3
    -> async POSTs to set room data
        POST https://gather.town/api/setMap
    -> hand back response https codes per call as we get them back
        plus any errors if we get them?


QUESTIONS / PROBLEMS
where to I get these things?
- apiKey: user is gonna submit this
    -> do we need to hold their hand in generating their API key?
    -> can users have more than one in case they forget theres and need to generate a new one?
- spaceId: user is gonna submit this
    -> are they able to find this? ..this seems like a big one..
- mapId: Id of the map within the space
    -> same questions as spaceId
- mapContent: 
    -> what does the json going to gather need to look like?
    -> can we /just/ send in the poster image stuff? or do we have to reset the entire room + the poster stuff?


THOUGHTS
had hoped we could create a new poster room using the stuff the user submitted
the createRoom endpoint creates an entirely new space! we don't want that .. we were hoping to create a new room
 - is there a way we can create a new room w/ an api call?
apparently users can copy an existing room into their own space
 - if a user could create a generic room that sits outside their space they wouldn't need an api key, or spaceId / mapId

// find all of the xy coords we can put a poster

1) cut two squares off each side of the room, use this smaller to set our xy coords for poster objects (probably easier to work w/ space starting at 1???)
    -> doing this to create border space
2) determine how many poster objects we can fit in this space
    -> poster object itself is 3x5
    -> need to include at min 2 squares on either side of it (except outer most which only need buffer space on the inward facing side)
    -> need to include at min 2 squares on top or bottom

// re-order that list so it starts in the center and works out
// assign coords based on that list


maybe actually take one of each of the 4 sides
then find how many poster obects that are 5x7 can fit in each axis without breaking the walls
use this number of total objects to find most equal spacing along each axis


36x34 room
usuable size is 34x32
x axis can fit 35/7 6 entire objects
y axis can fit 32/9 4 entire objects

this gets tricky... ok let's walk through it a bit
    - place objects extreme outsides -> 1 at x1 and 2 at x30
    - then get new width of available objects -> now have space of 24
    - modulo 24 x 5 -> get remainder of tiles we have on the x axis that we can use as padding between our remaining objects
    - remainder is going to be 4, 3, 2, or 1
    - need to take that remainder and divide it up among the remaining objects, so they can each have some spacing
    - take number of objects and divide the remainder amongst them
        -> this really only gets tricky for when there are == or fewer objects than extra tiles in the remainder
        -> if there are more objects than extra tiles, give them to the outer most objects
